# Weather Data Extractor

ScrapperNparser.py is a selenium based data scrapped that downloads data from a dynamic table from the weather website and transforma it into a CSV file.
The user is asked to put the start and end date and all of the data untill that date will be downloaded and saved in a csv file.

Note:
I havent used the headless fearute of  Selinium driver as it was causing some issues on my computer.
but if you want to add it you can add the headless property of the selinium chrome driver.
