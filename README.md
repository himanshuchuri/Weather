# Weather_data_etl 

ScrapperNparser.py is a selenium based data scrapped that downloads data from a dynamic table from the weather website and transforma it into a CSV file.
The user is asked to put the start and end date and all of the data untill that date will be downloaded and saved in a csv file.

Note:
I havent used the headless fearute ogf the Selinium driver a it was causing some issues on my computer.
but if you want to add it you can add the headless property of the selinium chrome driver.
